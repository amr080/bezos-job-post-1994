# Well-capitalized Seattle start-up seeks Unix developers

**Jeff Bezos**  
*8/22/94*

Well-capitalized start-up seeks extremely talented C/C++/Unix developers to help pioneer commerce on the Internet.  
You must have experience designing and building large and complex (yet maintainable) systems, and you should be  
able to do so in about one-third the time that most competent people think possible. You should have a BS, MS,  
or PhD in Computer Science or the equivalent. Top-notch communication skills are essential. Familiarity with  
web servers and HTML would be helpful but is not necessary.

Expect talented, motivated, intense, and interesting co-workers. Must be willing to relocate to the Seattle area  
(we will help cover moving costs).

Your compensation will include meaningful equity ownership.
